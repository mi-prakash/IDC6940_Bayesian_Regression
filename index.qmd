## Introduction

-   Rainfall prediction is challenging due to the complex and uncertain nature of weather systems, yet it is essential for environmental and disaster planning.

-   This project addresses the problem of modeling and predicting rainfall patterns using Bayesian regression to produce both predictions and uncertainty estimates.

-   The study is relevant as traditional regression methods often fail to capture prediction uncertainty in meteorological data.

-   The approach involves applying Bayesian regression to spatial–temporal rainfall data and comparing results with classical regression models through analysis and visualization.
